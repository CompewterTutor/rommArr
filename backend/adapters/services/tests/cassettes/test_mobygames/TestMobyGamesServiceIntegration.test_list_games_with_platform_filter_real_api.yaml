          of the Comet"}],"description":"<p>In 1834, in the small New England fishing
          village of Illsmouth, the distinguished British scientist Lord Boleskine lost
          his mind. After studying ancient manuscripts of evil repute, he had travelled
          to this place to observe the passing of Halley''s comet. What he observed
          that night, however, turned him into a raving lunatic. Now, 76 years later,
          Halley''s comet is coming back, and young reporter John T. Parker has travelled
          to Illsmouth to try to uncover the truth in Boleskine''s wild claims, and
          see the comet\nfor himself.</p>\n<p><em>Shadow of the Comet</em> is a horror
          adventure game, inspired by the terrifying writings of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/633/h-p-lovecraft/\">H.
          P. Lovecraft</a>. Contrary to many adventure games from the early 90s, the
          game has a keyboard driven interface with a system of actions activated either
          by pressing the corresponding key (L for look, G for get, T for talk, U for
          use) or selecting them from the menu activated by the TAB key. The CD release
          was enhanced with a mouse-driven interface. Typical for Infogrames titles
          (e.g. <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/1368/eternam/\">Eternam</a>),
          the game contains vector-based cut scenes with enlarged graphics of the faces
          of the speakers during dialogues.</p>\n<p>The GOG.com release of this game
          includes both Floppy and CD versions of the game. The main differences are
          new graphics, mouse-driven interface and full voice-acting whereas the Floppy
          version doesn''t feature any voice-acting. The CD version''s launcher screen
          additionally includes a <em>Museum</em> mini-game where character can walk
          through a museum and look at various mystical objects and paintings inspired
          by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/633/h-p-lovecraft/\">H. P. Lovecraft</a>.</p>","game_id":132,"genres":[{"genre_category":"Basic

          Black Mesa Research Facility is an ultra-secret laboratory under a government
          contract to conduct top-secret and extremely volatile experiments. The scientist
          Gordon Freeman is a Black Mesa employee. One morning, as usual, he pits his
          way to the research facility for a run-of-the-mill experiment. However, Gordon
          comes to realize that it might not be as ordinary as he thought. Odd things
          happen as he makes his way to one of the Black Mesa test chambers. Even stranger
          things happen when he begins to move the test sample towards the anti-mass
          spectrometer.</p>\n<p>At that moment, everything goes horribly wrong. Aliens
          from the dimension Xen suddenly invade the facility, injuring or killing many
          of the employees. Soon afterwards, marines arrive to contain the situation
          by killing the aliens as well as the surviving human witnesses. Gordon understands
          what that means: he will have to fight his way through both aliens and marines
          to get to the top of the Black Mesa complex and to freedom.</p>\n<p>The story
          of <em>Half-Life</em> is told entirely in-game: everything is seen through
          the eyes of the protagonist. Most story elements unfold via scripted sequences,
          triggered by the player reaching a certain area. If other characters have
          information to reveal, they address Gordon directly. The Black Mesa complex
          in the game is made up of both distinct levels which progress in a linear
          fashion as well as hubs where backtracking may be required to unlock further
          areas.</p>\n<p>The game''s weapon arsenal mostly consists of realistic weapons
          like pistols, machine guns and explosives, but there are also futuristic energy
          weapons developed at Black Mesa as well as organic weapons acquired from the
          invading aliens. Most weapons feature an alternate firing mode.</p>\n<p>Enemies
          fall into two categories: aliens and human soldiers. While most of the aliens
          are not very bright, the humans display some relatively advanced artificial
          intelligence: they seek cover, retreat when hit and try to drive the player
          from his cover by throwing grenades. Some of the alien enemies cannot be killed
          by normal means. The environment must be used against them instead, going
          with a general tendency of the game to alternate the combat with environmental
          puzzles. </p>\n<p>As of the 25th Anniversary Update from 17 November 2023,
          the Steam version of Half-Life includes content from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/25393/half-life-uplink/\">Half-Life:
