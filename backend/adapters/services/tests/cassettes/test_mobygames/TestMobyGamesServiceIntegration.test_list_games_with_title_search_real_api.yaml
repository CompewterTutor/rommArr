          Amy Rose travel to Never Lake, only to discover the legendary Little Planet
          there, tied in chains and covered by metal. It appears that Sonic''s archenemy,
          Dr. Eggman, is using the powers of the planet to manipulate the fabric of
          time. He created Sonic''s evil counterpart, Metal Sonic, who kidnaps Amy and
          disappears. Now the brave hedgehog must explore the Little Planet, collect
          seven jewels capable of altering the passage of time, free Amy, and defeat
          Metal Sonic along with his master. </p>\n<p><em>Sonic CD</em> is a fast-paced
          side-scrolling platform action game, similar in gameplay to other installments
          of the series. Sonic uses his patented spin attacks to destroy the doctor''s
          minions and collects various items, such as protective rings, shields, and
          speed shoes. His special attacks include the Spin Dash and the Super Peel
          Out. A stand-out gameplay feature of this installment is Sonic''s ability
          to travel to past and future versions of the stages he traverses. Depending
          on the player''s action in the past version of a level, the future versions
          (which contain obligatory boss enemies) will change from \"bad\" to \"good\",
          having more or fewer enemies and obstacles, respectively. </p>\n<p>Time Stones
          can be collected by completing special stages, in which Sonic has to shoot
          UFOs within an allotted time limit. The game''s \"good\" ending can be achieved
          either by collecting all the seven Time Stones or by turning all future level
          versions into \"good\". The game has features that take advantage of the CD
          format such as CD audio, video clips, and more levels (over fifty in total).</p>","game_id":3316,"genres":[{"genre_category":"Basic

          notices that the Flickies, his small, feathered friends that can travel between
          parallel worlds, were captured and turned into badniks (the robot enemies
          of Sonic) by Dr. Robotnik in his never-ending quest for the Chaos Emeralds.
          Seven levels separate Sonic from the final showdown with Robotnik.</p>\n<p><em>Sonic
          3D</em> was the last Sonic title released for the Mega Drive, the only platforming
          presence of the blue blur in the Sega Saturn, and one of his rare appearances
          in Personal Computers. The title, considering the era it was released, is
          somewhat misleading, as instead of full blown 3D graphics it uses an isometric
          view where Sonic can move not only forwards and backwards, but also left and
          right. </p>\n<p>Gameplay is much slower when compared to other games in the
          series, and the number of badniks is reduced to five in each section. As usual,
          when Sonic destroys one badnik, an animal leaps free from its insides, but
          this time Sonic has to pick him up and lead them to an interdimensional ring.
          While they can be taken one by one, exploring the level with all five allow
          the player to reach for otherwise inaccessible continue tokens. \nUnlike all
          other previous games, time isn''t a requirement: if the player completes a
          level in more than 10 minutes, it would only mean there would be no time bonus
          at the end. Finally, to collect all seven Chaos Emeralds, Sonic first must
          find Tails or Knuckles and offer them at least 50 rings.</p>","game_id":3494,"genres":[{"genre_category":"Basic

          themselves wrapped up in the schemes of Dr. Robotnik. This time he plans to
          exploit the power of Chaos, a malevolent being that feeds upon the power of
          the Chaos Emeralds. In their own way, five heroes will do what they can to
          save Station Square and, perhaps, the entire world.</p>\n<p>The player can
          select from which character to play after meeting them with Sonic, and each
          has its own unique version of each level. Sonic''s levels involve racing through
          a level as quickly as possible, destroying any robots along the way. Tails
          can hover over distances, and his levels are similar to Sonic''s except that
          he must beat an opponent to the finish line. Amy can''t charge up ramps or
          run as quickly as Sonic and Tails, but she does have a giant hammer she can
          break obstacles with. The goal of her levels is to avoid being captured by
          a robot sent after her by Dr. Robotnik. E102 Gamma is a slow, difficult to
          maneuver robot, but it has guns and missiles that can lock on to several targets
          at once, chaining together attacks and earning a higher score and more time
          on the clock. The goal of its levels is to reach a boss enemy and destroy
          it before time runs out. The final character is Big the Cat, a fisherman searching
          for his lost frog. Big''s levels are almost entirely devoid of action or fighting;
          he just fishes. Each character can find items that increase their abilities
          as the story progresses, such as a ring for Sonic that lets him home along
          lines of rings, or improved lures for Big. A final chapter wrapping up the
          story is unlocked after all other characters have been completed.</p>\n<p>Additionally,
          each of the characters can visit the Chao garden where they can raise baby
          Chaos. By petting, feeding, and showing animals found in levels to the Chaos
          they can grow stronger, and optionally be put into races against other Chaos.
          As well each level in the game has additional objectives that can be completed
          to acquire extra emblems, although the emblems don''t do anything in this
          version of the game. Finally, at one time it was possible to go online and
          download additional levels and bonuses in the game, such as a Christmas theme
          for Station Square and a level sponsored by AT&amp;T, but since SegaNet shut
          down this is no longer possible.</p>","game_id":3530,"genres":[{"genre_category":"Basic
