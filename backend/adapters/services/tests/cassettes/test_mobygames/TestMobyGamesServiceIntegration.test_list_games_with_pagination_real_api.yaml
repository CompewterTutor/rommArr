          one of the most long-running television series of all time, <em>The X-Files</em>,
          play through the eyes of Special Agent Craig Willmore, a new FBI field investigator
          brought in to locate missing agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully whose last
          location was the Everett, Washington, area. In this \"movie quality\" video
          production, characters are played by the actors and actresses from the show,
          including <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/9411/gillian-anderson/\">Gillian
          Anderson</a> (Scully) and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/9412/david-duchovny/\">David
          Duchovny</a> (Mulder).</p>\n<p>As the game begins, you are given a briefing
          of your mission. Gather up all state-of-the-art spy tools (night vision goggles,
          a digital camera, PDA, lock picks, evidence kit, a standard issue revolver,
          handcuffs and badge) and then head out to follow their trail. As you explore
          the various locations, take photographs, pick up pieces of evidence and talk
          with people. Use your Newton PDA to access the navigational map, to make notes
          and send/receive e-mail. Trace telephone numbers, run background checks and
          license plate ids and even post an All Points Bulletin on missing persons
          using the computer network at your home or office. By using photo viewer software,
          download field photographs to the computer where they can be enlarged and
          studied more closely for clues.</p>\n<p>Features include emotion icons for
          interjecting different tones during conversations (mean, humorous or technical)
          which effect the answer given. An in-game hint system, Artificial Intelligence,
          can be set on or off. In addition, there are multiple endings as a direct
          result of actions you take.</p>","game_id":1,"genres":[{"genre_category":"Basic
