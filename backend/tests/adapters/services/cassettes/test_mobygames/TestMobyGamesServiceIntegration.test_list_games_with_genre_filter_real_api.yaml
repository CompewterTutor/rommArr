          the will is nowhere to be found. You have to find the will and save your wife,
          Jessica, from Judge Doom and his weasels.</p>\n<p>The game takes place in
          Hollywood, 1947, where Toons are alive. There are 4 levels in the game, 2
          of which are driving levels (levels 1 &amp; 3). Roger and Benny the cab have
          to beat the weasels to the destination, while dodging cars, trams and Judge
          Doom''s dip which is scattered on the road. There are pick-ups to help you
          on your way.</p>\n<p>Level 2 is the Ink &amp; Paint Club. The will is on one
          of the tables. Roger has to pick up all the pieces of paper the penguin waiters
          put down, whilst avoiding the alcohol and gorilla bouncer.</p>\n<p>Level 4
          has you in Judge Doom''s warehouse trying to save your wife, Jessica, from

          is an arcade game combining elements of the popular arcade games <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/139/dig-dug/\">Dig
          Dug</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/9764/mr-do/\">Mr. Do!</a>.
          Players control the titular ''Digger'' that can tunnel through dirt with ease.
          The goal of each level is to gather up each of the gems, which allows you
          to progress to the next stage. However, Nobbins and Hobbins are also lurking
          within the levels - Nobbins are fairly slow, but transform into Hobbins which
          are much quicker. The enemies can only chase Digger through the tunnels he
          creates - they cannot dig through the dirt themselves.</p>\n<p>Digger''s defenses
          consist of being able to shoot a single, rechargeable shot in the direction
          he is facing with F1 (which recharges after about thirty seconds), crushing
          his foes by digging underneath a gold bag and letting it plummet down, crushing
          anything in its path, or by collecting the bonus cherry that sometimes appears,
          causing Digger to become temporarily invincible.</p>","game_id":18,"genres":[{"genre_category":"Basic
